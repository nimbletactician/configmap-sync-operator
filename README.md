The configmap-operator is a Kubernetes operator for managing ConfigMaps by
  synchronizing them from various external sources. Let me break down the
  controller flow:

  Custom Resource Definition

  - ConfigMapSource: Defines where to pull configuration from and where to
  store it
  - Supported sources:
    - Git repositories (with SSH authentication)
    - Files on the operator's filesystem
    - Existing ConfigMaps
    - Kubernetes Secrets

  Controller Flow

  1. Initialization:
    - Controller watches for ConfigMapSource resources
    - Sets up RBAC permissions to manage ConfigMaps and read Secrets
  2. Reconciliation Loop:
    - Triggered when ConfigMapSource resources are created/updated/deleted
    - Adds a finalizer to handle cleanup on deletion
  3. Main Processing Flow:
    - Handle deletion if resource is being deleted
    - Determine target namespace (use source namespace if not specified)
    - Fetch configuration data from specified source
    - Calculate hash of config data for change detection
    - Skip update if configuration hasn't changed
    - Create or update target ConfigMap with fetched data
    - Set owner reference if in same namespace (for garbage collection)
    - Update status with sync time, hash, and success condition
    - Requeue based on refresh interval for periodic updates
  4. Source-specific Fetching Logic:
    - Git: Clones repository, optionally uses SSH auth from a Secret
    - File: Reads configuration from local filesystem
    - ConfigMap: Copies data from an existing ConfigMap (optionally filtering
  keys)
    - Secret: Copies data from a Secret (optionally filtering keys)
  5. Deletion Handling:
    - Only deletes the target ConfigMap if it's in the same namespace and owned
   by this resource
    - Removes finalizer to allow Kubernetes to complete deletion
  6. Utilities:
    - readConfigFiles: Reads configuration from files (supports directory of
  files or single file)
    - calculateConfigHash: Creates consistent hash for change detection
    - setStatusCondition: Updates resource status conditions
    - requeueBasedOnRefreshInterval: Schedules periodic reconciliation

  Key Features

  - Change detection using content hashing
  - Periodic synchronization with configurable intervals
  - Support for multiple configuration sources
  - Proper cleanup of owned resources
  - Status tracking with conditions
  - Cross-namespace support with ownership tracking

  The controller follows the Kubernetes operator pattern, watching resources
  and maintaining the desired state by reconciling the actual state with the
  desired state defined in the ConfigMapSource resources.
